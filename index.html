                    <h4>Project Goals</h4>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to create an RPG that gave the player a wide range of abilities without forcing them to choose between a few and still be executable within a few button presses.
                        Inspired by Final Fantasy 14, I used trigger buttons as gates for ability usage, enabling more abilities with minimal button clutter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another goal was to design enemies that worked together, using timed attacks and formations. Ground telegraphs created engaging scenarios, requiring the player to solve puzzles in combat and align with level design.
                    </p>

               <!-- Priority Target System -->
<div class="text-video-section">
    <h4>Priority Target System</h4>
    <p>
        In my research on targeting systems, I observed that most games use direction and distance for manual enemy lock-on. 
        Innovating on this, I considered expanding targeting factors to include abilities and elemental stances. 
        This led to the development of the Priority Target System, which offers both a traditional manual lock-on with a focus camera 
        and a 'no lock' option where the system aids the player based on their current stance.
    </p>

   <h5>Stance Specifics</h5>
    <p>
        Base/<strong class="fire">Fire</strong>/<strong class="water">Water</strong>: Auto-attack and close distance to the nearest enemy.<br>
        <strong class="lightning">Lightning:</strong> Prioritize interrupting enemy casts, then target distant foes.<br>
        <strong class="wind">Wind:</strong> Focus on enemies within AoE range.
    </p>

    <h5>System Benefits</h5>
    <p>
        Reduces target cycling.<br>
        Guides new players on stance and ability usage.<br>
        Allows player choice for targeting priority.

                <!-- Elemental Stances -->
                <div class="text-video-section">
                    <h4>Elemental Stances</h4>
                    <p>
                        Players can switch between the following stances to enhance strategy and combat choices:
                        </br>
                        <span class="fire">Fire:</span> High single target damage.<br>
                        <span class="water">Water:</span> Crowd control.<br>
                        <span class="lightning">Lightning:</span> Ranged abilities for distant foes.<br>
                        <span class="wind">Wind:</span> Area of effect attacks.

                <!-- Critical Hits -->
                <div class="text-video-section">
                    <h4>Critical Hits</h4>
                    <p>
                        Critical hits in Solace aren't random. Instead, they're triggered by ability synergies. For instance, applying the Burn status and following up with a Water attack creates an explosion for a critical hit. Critical hits throw enemies off balance, with bold text feedback for players.
                    </p>
                    <video autoplay loop muted controls width="560" height="315">

                <div class="text-video-section">
                    <h4>Hot Bar</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Hot Bar allows quick access to abilities segmented by gamepad triggers for intuitive gameplay. Originally designed with 16 buttons, playtesting led to streamlining it to 8 buttons to reduce clutter while maintaining functionality.

                <div class="text-video-section">
                    <h4>Teleportation System</h4>
                    <p>
                        Redesigned for a player-centric approach, the teleportation system provides dynamic mobility. Players can instantly move to specific locations, enhancing exploration and dodging mechanics. It also includes a unique parry mechanic called Teleport Strike.

                    <h4>Enemy Formation System</h4>
                    <p>
                        Enemies in Solace work together with synchronized attacks, requiring players to think strategically. Attack telegraphs and coordinated formations create engaging combat puzzles that challenge player response and positioning.
