                    <h4>Project Goals</h4>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to create an RPG that gave the player a wide range of abilities without forcing them to choose between a few and still be executable within a few button presses.
                        Inspired by Final Fantasy 14, I used trigger buttons as gates for ability usage, enabling more abilities with minimal button clutter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another goal was to design enemies that worked together, using timed attacks and formations. Ground telegraphs created engaging scenarios, requiring the player to solve puzzles in combat and align with level design.
                    </p>

                <div class="text-video-section">
                    <h4>Priority Target System</h4>
                    <p>
                        In my research on targeting systems, I observed that most games use direction and distance for manual enemy lock-on.
                        Innovating on this, I considered expanding targeting factors to include abilities and elemental stances.
                        This led to the development of the Priority Target System, which offers both a traditional manual lock-on with a focus camera
                        and a 'no lock' option where the system aids the player based on their current stance.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Stance Specifics</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Base/<strong class="fire">Fire</strong>/<strong class="water">Water</strong>: Auto-attack and close distance to the nearest enemy.<br>
                        <strong class="lightning">Lightning:</strong> Prioritize interrupting enemy casts, then target distant foes.<br>
                        <strong class="wind">Wind:</strong> Focus on enemies within AoE range.

                        Critical hits in Solace aren't random. Instead, they're triggered by ability synergies. For instance, applying the Burn status and following up with a Water attack creates an explosion for a critical hit. Critical hits throw enemies off balance, with bold text feedback for players.

                <h4>Game Concept</h4>
                <p>
                    My vision for the game was to create a simple puzzle game that is easy to pick up, set aside, and be a source of mental stimulation. 
                    While younger audiences may be challenged by the color combining, any age can enjoy the puzzle aspect. I committed to a player-friendly 
                    approach, avoiding microtransactions and integrating advertisements fairly. Players can either watch ads to regain lives or wait for them to regenerate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Educationally, the game introduces younger players to color theory, particularly in creating secondary colors, while stimulating 
                    cognitive skills through thoughtfully designed puzzles. This blend of simplicity, educational value, and ethical design forms the game's core.
                </p>

            <div class="text-video-section">
                <h4>Optimized Engine for Level & Puzzle Creation</h4>
                <p>
                    I optimized the game engine by developing a map generator actor, enabling the creation of dynamic X by X grids. 
                    This tool streamlined level design, allowing for rapid customization of tile types, colors, and layouts. It also facilitated the creation 
                    of gaps and the designation of starting tiles, significantly enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of level development.

                    - <strong>Starting Tile:</strong> Marks the puzzle's starting point for the player.<br>
                    - <strong>Blob Tile:</strong> Restores health, resizes the player's blob, and can change its color.<br>
                    - <strong>Bomb Tile:</strong> Gives the player a bomb that can be detonated at will.<br>
                    - <strong>Fan Tile:</strong> Spreads the player's blob color to all tiles in a straight line.

                    <strong>Bomb Mechanic:</strong> Players acquire a bomb by moving onto its tile, which can be detonated at their discretion. 
                    The explosion spreads the player's blob and color to adjacent tiles, programmed using a trace function to identify and alter neighboring tiles' colors. 
                    Smaller blobs interpolate to the center of each affected tile for a visually impactful effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fan Mechanic:</strong> This tile blows the player's color across a straight line of tiles, excluding any between the player and the fan. 
                    Traces identify tiles in the direct line of effect, requiring players to plan their moves carefully for tactical advantage.

            <h3>Grappling Game: Combat Design</h3>

            <!-- Project Goals -->
            <div class="text-video-section">
                <h4>Project Goals</h4>
                <p>
                    The primary objective of this game is to center its design around the grappling mechanic. Drawing inspiration from iconic games like 
                    <em>Mario</em>, known for its focus on jumping, and <em>Sonic</em>, with its emphasis on speed, the game delivers a high-quality, immersive experience around a single core action: grappling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently, grappling has been integrated as a side mechanic in many games. I wanted to explore what a game would look like with grappling 
                    as the main focus, particularly in combat. This concept guided my design approach.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Identifying Player Actions -->
            <div class="text-video-section">
                <h4>Identifying Player Actions</h4>
                <p>
                    To design enemies effectively, I began by identifying the possible actions players could perform with the grappling mechanic. These 
                    actions form the "verbs" of the gameplay and drive enemy interactions:
                </p>
                <p>
                    - <strong>Pull:</strong> Attach the grapple to an object and pull it toward the player.<br>
                    - <strong>Swing:</strong> Create a rope swing to traverse areas (dependent on the grappled object).<br>
                    - <strong>Climb:</strong> Ascend when suspended over a drop.<br>
                    - <strong>Spin:</strong> Rotate an attached object around the player in a circular path (object size-dependent).
                </p>
                <p>
                    These core actions informed enemy design, with "Pull" becoming a central element of the main combat loop. For example, enemies are 
                    powered by batteries, and the player must pull these batteries out to defeat them.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Enemy Design Pillars -->
            <div class="text-video-section">
                <h4>Enemy Design Pillars</h4>
                <p>
                    To ensure dynamic and engaging encounters, I established three key pillars for enemy design:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>1. Size:</strong> Size influences the actions players can take on enemies. Larger enemies drag the player when grappled, while 
                    smaller enemies can be manipulated freely. Visual and gameplay feedback communicate these size differences clearly, with height, 
                    width, and scale exaggerated for clarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>2. Battery Location:</strong> Enemies have batteries that power them. Identifying and targeting these batteries is a core part 
                    of combat. Batteries are visibly marked, giving players strategic visual cues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3. Reaction:</strong> Enemies react uniquely when grappled. Some try to shake players off, others become aggressive, and some 
                    might pull the player toward them. Understanding these reactions is essential for mastery and rewards skilled players.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Enemy Interaction Concepts -->
            <div class="text-video-section">
                <h4>Enemy Interaction Concepts</h4>
                <p>
                    Establishing these pillars led to brainstorming various enemy interactions, creating unique challenges for players. Examples include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    - An enemy with a constantly shifting battery location.<br>
                    - An enemy that hides its battery, revealing it only during attacks.<br>

                <p>
                    With the design concepts in place, I began prototyping the first enemy. This prototype features a constantly moving battery that 
                    spins in a slow, continuous motion. Players must stay focused on the battery's location during combat, adding intensity and challenge.
