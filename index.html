                <p>
                    As part of the development team for Pantheon Rift, the following contributions were made to enhance
                    the gameplay and systems:
                </p>
                </br>
                <ul>
                    <p><strong class="highlight">Animation Retargeting:</strong> Adapted animations for different
                        character meshes and skeletons using Unreal Engine's retargeting tools, ensuring consistent and
                        high-quality animations across all character models.</p>
                    <p><strong class="highlight">Attack Data Management:</strong> Created data assets for weapon
                        attacks, including variables for animation montages, speeds, and sound effects. Integrated these
                        assets into weapon blueprints to streamline combo setups.</p>
                    <p><strong class="highlight">Combat Mechanics Development:</strong> Implemented melee and ranged
                        weapon systems, including equipping, attacking, and blocking mechanics. Contributed to features
                        inspired by souls-likes and casual shooters.</p>
                    <p><strong class="highlight">Dodge System:</strong> Developed a dodge mechanic using vector math for
                        directionality, with root motion for smooth animations and invincibility frames (I-frames) for
                        balanced gameplay.</p>
                    <p><strong class="highlight">Poise and Stagger System:</strong> Designed a poise mechanic to prevent
                        player stagger, integrated poise damage into weapon interactions, and implemented regeneration
                        with visual feedback systems.</p>
                    <p><strong class="highlight">AI Spawning Systems:</strong> Optimized AI spawning processes by
                        developing dynamic spawning mechanics, allowing creatures like sheep to spawn within specified
                        radii with randomized positions and orientations.</p>

                    <h4>Project Goals</h4>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to create an RPG that gave the player a wide range of abilities without forcing them to
                        choose between a few and still be executable within a few button presses.
                        Inspired by Final Fantasy 14, I used trigger buttons as gates for ability usage, enabling more
                        abilities with minimal button clutter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another goal was to design enemies that worked together, using timed attacks and formations.
                        Ground telegraphs created engaging scenarios, requiring the player to solve puzzles in combat
                        and align with level design.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Accomplishments -->

                <!-- Priority Target System -->
                <div class="text-video-section">
                    <h4>Priority Target System</h4>
                    <p>
                        In my research on targeting systems, I observed that most games use direction and distance for
                        manual enemy lock-on.
                        Innovating on this, I considered expanding targeting factors to include abilities and elemental
                        stances.
                        This led to the development of the Priority Target System, which offers both a traditional
                        manual lock-on with a focus camera
                        and a 'no lock' option where the system aids the player based on their current stance.
                    </p>
                    <p>Stance Specifics</p>
                    <p>
                        Base/<strong class="fire">Fire</strong>/<strong class="water">Water</strong>: Auto-attack and
                        close distance to the nearest enemy.<br>
                        <strong class="lightning">Lightning:</strong> Prioritize interrupting enemy casts, then target
                        distant foes.<br>
                        <strong class="wind">Wind:</strong> Focus on enemies within AoE range.

                <div class="text-video-section">
                    <h4>Elemental Stances</h4>
                    <p>
                        Players can switch between the following stances to enhance strategy and combat choices:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="fire">Fire:</span> High single target damage.<br>
                        <span class="water">Water:</span> Crowd control.<br>
                        <span class="lightning">Lightning:</span> Ranged abilities for distant foes.<br>
                        <span class="wind">Wind:</span> Area of effect attacks.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Critical Hits -->
                <div class="text-video-section">
                    <h4>Critical Hits</h4>
                    <p>
                        Critical hits in Solace aren't random. Instead, they're triggered by ability synergies. For
                        instance, applying the Burn status and following up with a Water attack creates an explosion for
                        a critical hit. Critical hits throw enemies off balance, with bold text feedback for players. In this example, Fire abilities followed by Water create dense steam signalling to the player that something has happened.

                    <h4>Hot Bar</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Hot Bar allows quick access to abilities segmented by gamepad triggers for intuitive
                        gameplay. Originally designed with 16 buttons, playtesting revealed that a more streamlined
                        approach was needed. I reduced the Hot Bar to 8 buttons, maintaining the game's core goals while
                        minimizing UI clutter and ensuring each ability was distinct and meaningful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Hot Bar tracks cooldown times, ability resource costs, and ability status, expanding as
                        needed and clearly indicating locked abilities, providing players with an intuitive and
                        efficient interface.

                <!-- Player Ability System -->
                <div class="text-video-section">
                    <h4>Player Ability System</h4>
                    <p>
                        Inspired by Final Fantasy 14, I aimed to create an ability system that makes players feel
                        powerful and in control. The design mirrors the concept of having a "rotation," where players
                        can maximize damage by finding the optimal arrangement and usage of abilities with their
                        cooldowns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system includes abilities that inflict debuffs and damage over time (DoT). Players need to
                        keep their DoT abilities active and maintain debuffs on enemies, then use finishers to maximize
                        their damage output. This approach reflects the strategic rotations found in MMOs, encouraging
                        players to think critically about their ability usage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The abilities in "Solace" feature a horizontal progression system. Players collect materials
                        from fallen enemies to upgrade abilities, enhancing their strength and adding new effects. For
                        example, upgrading the "Bubble" ability traps enemies in water and deals damage over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When designing "Solace," I faced constraints due to my limited skills in animation and VFX,
                        which led to removing some planned skills. To tackle this, I creatively used available
                        marketplace assets, tailoring animations to fit various abilities and managing the budget for
                        essential animations.

                <div class="text-video-section">
                    <h4>Teleportation System</h4>
                    <p>
                        The teleportation feature in Solace allows players to move instantly to specific locations
                        within a defined range. This mechanic is vital for dodging enemy attacks and uncovering hidden
                        paths, offering players a dynamic tool for both combat and exploration. By enhancing mobility,
                        it maintains player engagement and enables strategic gameplay.

                        Initially, the teleportation system was tied to an ally character, which restricted movement and
                        limited its effectiveness. To better align with the game's elemental theme, I reimagined
                        teleportation as a lightning-based ability. This redesign not only integrated it into the game's
                        world but also empowered players with greater control. The mechanic now allows players to
                        respond quickly to enemy formations and reposition strategically during combat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system also includes a unique mechanic called "Teleport Strike," where players can teleport
                        behind enemies and deliver a precise counterattack. This ability emphasizes timing and reflexes,
                        adding depth to combat interactions and reinforcing the sense of mastery in gameplay. By
                        leveraging existing assets and systems, I crafted a responsive and thematic teleportation
                        mechanic that enhances both the narrative and the player's experience.

                <div class="text-video-section">
                    <h4>Enemy Formation System</h4>
                    <p>
                        I aimed to design enemies that challenge players both individually and as coordinated groups,
                        enhancing combat dynamics and immersion. By demonstrating enemies working together, players face
                        strategic challenges that require quick thinking and precise movement. A key design philosophy
                        behind the enemy formations is to simulate intelligent behavior you would see with real squads
                        of soldiers. Enemies are programmed to work together, creating dynamic encounters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The combat system features enemies with timed attack abilities, highlighted by ground telegraphs
                        for player anticipation. Telegraphing attacks becomes crucial when multiple enemies use
                        abilities simultaneously or as part of formations, creating small "puzzle" encounters that
                        require strategic player responses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ensuring that the difficulty level remains fair while still challenging is crucial. To achieve
                        this, enemies display the names of the abilities they are using. This allows players to memorize
                        and recognize incoming attacks, giving them the opportunity to anticipate and react
                        appropriately in future encounters. The design philosophy focuses on providing clear feedback
                        and opportunities for the player to learn and adapt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The coordinated enemy attacks are designed to encourage players to think strategically. Players
                        must analyze enemy formations, predict their movements, and respond with appropriate abilities.
                        This promotes a deeper level of engagement and rewards players for mastering the game's
                        mechanics.

                        Sora‚Äôs Keyblade in Kingdom Hearts sets a high standard for RPG combat with its weighty and
                        impactful animations, creating a sense of momentum and realism in every swing. Inspired by this,
                        I aimed to replicate that satisfying feel in my game‚Äôs basic attacks. Through careful animation
                        selection and adjustments, I fine-tuned the motions to deliver a similar sense of impact,
                        ensuring each strike feels fluid, powerful, and rewarding for the player.

                <div class="text-video-section">
                    <h4>Game Concept</h4>
                    <p>
                        My vision for the game was to create a simple puzzle game that is easy to pick up, set aside,
                        and be a source of mental stimulation.
                        While younger audiences may be challenged by the color combining, any age can enjoy the puzzle
                        aspect. I committed to a player-friendly
                        approach, avoiding microtransactions and integrating advertisements fairly. Players can either
                        watch ads to regain lives or wait for them to regenerate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Educationally, the game introduces younger players to color theory, particularly in creating
                        secondary colors, while stimulating
                        cognitive skills through thoughtfully designed puzzles. This blend of simplicity, educational
                        value, and ethical design forms the game's core.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Optimized Engine for Level & Puzzle Creation</h4>
                    <p>
                        I optimized the game engine by developing a map generator actor, enabling the creation of
                        dynamic X by X grids.
                        This tool streamlined level design, allowing for rapid customization of tile types, colors, and
                        layouts. It also facilitated the creation
                        of gaps and the designation of starting tiles, significantly enhancing the efficiency and
                        flexibility of level development.

                        <strong>Key Features:</strong><br>
                        - <strong>Starting Tile:</strong> Marks the puzzle's starting point for the player.<br>
                        - <strong>Blob Tile:</strong> Restores health, resizes the player's blob, and can change its
                        color.<br>
                        - <strong>Bomb Tile:</strong> Gives the player a bomb that can be detonated at will.<br>
                        - <strong>Fan Tile:</strong> Spreads the player's blob color to all tiles in a straight line.

                    <h4>Mechanics</h4>
                    <p>
                        The game features multiple tile mechanics, enriching the gameplay with strategic elements that
                        encourage players to think creatively to solve puzzles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Bomb Mechanic:</strong> Players acquire a bomb by moving onto its tile, which can be
                        detonated at their discretion.
                        The explosion spreads the player's blob and color to adjacent tiles, programmed using a trace
                        function to identify and alter neighboring tiles' colors.
                        Smaller blobs interpolate to the center of each affected tile for a visually impactful effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Fan Mechanic:</strong> This tile blows the player's color across a straight line of
                        tiles, excluding any between the player and the fan.
                        Traces identify tiles in the direct line of effect, requiring players to plan their moves
                        carefully for tactical advantage.

                    <p>
                        In Palette Path, I designed the gameplay progression around the Introduce, Practice, and Master
                        pacing structure to create an engaging learning curve. Each mechanic is first introduced with
                        straightforward levels that allow players to grasp its functionality in isolation. This is
                        followed by practice levels, where players encounter the mechanic in increasingly varied and
                        complex scenarios, ensuring they build confidence and familiarity. Finally, I integrate multiple
                        mechanics together, presenting intricate challenges that truly test the player's puzzle-solving
                        skills. This progressive structure encourages mastery while maintaining a balance of challenge
                        and satisfaction, ensuring players feel rewarded for their growth and ingenuity.

                    <h4>Project Goals</h4>
                    <p>
                        The primary objective of this game is to center its design around the grappling mechanic.
                        Drawing inspiration from iconic games like
                        <em>Mario</em>, known for its focus on jumping, and <em>Sonic</em>, with its emphasis on speed,
                        the game delivers a high-quality, immersive experience around a single core action: grappling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recently, grappling has been integrated as a side mechanic in many games. I wanted to explore
                        what a game would look like with grappling
                        as the main focus, particularly in combat. This concept guided my design approach.

                    <p>
                        To design enemies effectively, I began by identifying the possible actions players could perform
                        with the grappling mechanic. These
                        actions form the "verbs" of the gameplay and drive enemy interactions:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - <strong>Pull:</strong> Attach the grapple to an object and pull it toward the player.<br>
                        - <strong>Swing:</strong> Create a rope swing to traverse areas (dependent on the grappled
                        object).<br>
                        - <strong>Climb:</strong> Ascend when suspended over a drop.<br>
                        - <strong>Spin:</strong> Rotate an attached object around the player in a circular path (object
                        size-dependent).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong class="highlight">These core actions informed enemy design, with "Pull" becoming a central element of the main
                        combat loop. For example, enemies are
                        powered by batteries, and the player must pull these batteries out to defeat them.</strong>

                        <strong>1. Size:</strong> Size influences the actions players can take on enemies. Larger
                        enemies drag the player when grappled, while
                        smaller enemies can be manipulated freely. Visual and gameplay feedback communicate these size
                        differences clearly, with height,
                        width, and scale exaggerated for clarity.

                    <p>
                        <strong>2. Battery Location:</strong> Enemies have batteries that power them. Identifying and
                        targeting these batteries is a core part
                        of combat. Batteries are visibly marked, giving players strategic visual cues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>3. Reaction:</strong> Enemies react uniquely when grappled. Some try to shake players
                        off, others become aggressive, and some
                        might pull the player toward them. Understanding these reactions is essential for mastery and
                        rewards skilled players.

                    <h4>Enemy Interaction Concepts</h4>
                    <p>
                        Establishing these pillars led to brainstorming various enemy interactions, creating unique
                        challenges for players. Examples include:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - An enemy with a constantly shifting battery location.<br>
                        - An enemy that hides its battery, revealing it only during attacks.<br>
                        - An enemy that spins uncontrollably when grappled, damaging the player unless they detach.<br>
                        - An enemy that cuts the player's grapple wire, forcing players to prioritize them.<br>
                        - An enemy that counters the player's pull action by grabbing the wire and pulling the player
                        toward it.<br>
                        - An enemy that detaches smaller enemies for the player to spin as a weapon.<br>
                        - An enemy that manipulates the environment, creating hazardous areas and forcing players to
                        stay airborne.<br>
                        - An enemy that retrieves detached batteries, requiring players to act quickly.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Prototyping Enemies</h4>
                    <p>
                        With the design concepts in place, I began prototyping the first enemy. This prototype features
                        a constantly moving battery that
                        spins in a slow, continuous motion. Players must stay focused on the battery's location during
                        combat, adding intensity and challenge.
